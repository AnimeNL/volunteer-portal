# API Documentation
The volunteer portal requires a number of API calls in order to work properly. They can be provided
by any back-end, as long as the returned data matches the specification below. Both request and
response structures must be given as JSON.

## /api/auth
Allows an authentication token (`authToken`) to be obtained for given credentials. The token may
have an expiration time, which should be validated on both the client and server-side.

### Request (`IAuthRequest`)
A `POST` request containing the following HTML form encoded fields.

| Property         | Type     | Description |
| :---             | :---     | :--- |
| `emailAddress`   | `string` | The e-mail address associated to authenticate with. |
| `accessCode`     | `string` | Access code given to the person who owns this e-mail address. |

### Response (`IAuthResponse`)
| Property  | Type      | Description |
| :---      | :---      | :---        |
| `authToken`           | `string?`   | Unique token which can be used to fetch protected content. Omitted on failure. |
| `authTokenExpiration` | `number?`   | Time at which the authentication token expires. Indicated as a UNIX timestamp in UTC. |

## /api/content
Allows static content to be obtained for the registration sub-application, as well as other pages
that can be displayed on the portal. The `<App>` component is responsible for routing these.

### Request
A `GET` request with no additional payload.

### Response (`IContentResponse`)
| Property         | Type      | Description |
| :---             | :---      | :--- |
| `pages`          | `IContentResponsePage[]` | Array of the pages that are available as plain content. |

### Response (`IContentResponsePage`)
| Property         | Type      | Description |
| :---             | :---      | :--- |
| `pathname`       | `string` | Full pathname through which this content can be identified. |
| `content`        | `string` | Contents of the page. May contain [Markdown syntax](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). |
| `modified`       | `number` | Last modification time of the page. Indicated as a UNIX timestamp in UTC. |

  * **Note**: Where there are duplicated `pathname` values, the last one will be used.
  * **Note**: Directories represented as pages should have an index. If `/foo/bar.html` is a thing, then so should `/foo/` be.

## /api/environment
Allows information to be obtained for the environment the volunteer portal runs under. This allows
multiple events to be managed by the same instance without needing to change the frontend.

### Request
A `GET` request with no additional payload.

the authentication token, as for appropriate display of their information in the user interface.

### Administrators
The portal has a number of exceptions and behaviours reserved for users who are administrators. The API endpoint is expected to always validate whether a user _actually_ is an administrator when privileged actions are committed.

    * Administrators can always access the scheduling sub-application for an event.

### Event roles
There are three predefined event roles: `Unregistered`, `Registered`, `Rejected`. Any other string value may be used to represent that the volunteer has been accepted, and describe their actual role. (E.g. `Volunteer` or `Event Elf`.)
